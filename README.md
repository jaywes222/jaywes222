- 👋  Jambo, I'm Jack Jr. (aka JJ/Codes)
- **👀 Who am I?** Just a simple human navigating life, learning from experiences, and eventually pretending to understand its lessons.
- **🌱 Currently leveling up in:** React – because I like building things that make me look smarter than I am.
- **💞️ Collaboration dreams:** Looking to team up on React or Flutter projects. Together, we can make coding look less like magic and more like "Oh, that's how it works!"
- **📫 How to reach me:** Shoot me an email at wesleyjay202@gmail.com. I check it like it's my Instagram DMs, so go ahead, I dare you. 👀
- **⚡ Fun fact:** Failed my driving test once, but still managed to get a license. If that doesn’t scream "perseverance," I don't know what does!

**🛠️ Languages and Frameworks:**
- *JavaScript* – My BFF in the coding world
- *React* – We're in a committed relationship
- *Flutter* – Still figuring this one out, but I’m dedicated
- *HTML & CSS* – The classics never die

I'm always happy to talk about life, code, or how to fail a driving test with style. 👨‍💻
